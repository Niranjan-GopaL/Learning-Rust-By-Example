- we need an external crate (carate : VERY SMALL PACKAGES)

RUST's way

            crates 
            packages

( and just like in npm u'll need to install this external crate }"package essentially"{ )
THIS IS SOO AWESOME cuz rust wont have to install 
really big packages just to use one of its fn
